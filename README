**Note to Professor:**

Despite the challenging schedule and the responsibility of tackling this project solo, alongside preparing for the exams, I have managed to build the foundational features of the application. Although it is currently at its halfway mark, I am fully committed to adding the remaining functionalities, including employee, customer, and sales management, as well as integrating a dashboard with Chart.js for analytics.

The authentication system is prepared with frontend pages for login, registration, and user management; the backend logic will be completed in the coming days. Other features like exporting tables to PDF format are also on the agenda.

I am confident in my ability to deliver a comprehensive application by January 25th. Your understanding of the current status and recognition of the solo effort put into this project are greatly appreciated. Inchallah, with focused effort and determination, the final version will be ready for presentation.

Thank you for your support and guidance throughout this journey.
